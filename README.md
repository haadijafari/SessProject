# Sess Project

When I've got into university I faced a huge problem in which I had to deal with every semester, THE UNIT SELECTION!

In order to see the available units we had to check every course one by one. So I wrote a python program to make this process easier.

This program will extract all the usefull information into a CSV file to make your life easier!

## Usage/Examples

Create a ``user_pass.txt`` in project directory and enter your sess username and password:
``` text
[USERNAME]
[PASSWORD]
```
Run the project and enjoy!
```bash
python main.py
```
